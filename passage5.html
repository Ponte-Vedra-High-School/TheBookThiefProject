  <p><strong>Passage 5: Statement of Theme</strong>
    <br>“I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn’t already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race- that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant. None of those things, however, came out of my mouth. All I was able to do was turn to Liesel Meminger and tell her the only truth I know. I said it to the book thief and I say it now to you.
    <br>***A LAST NOTE FROM YOUR NARRATOR***
    <br>I am haunted by humans.” 
    <br>– The Book Thief, page 550
    <br>This passage is the last part of the novel, and expresses the theme that while there is good, human destruction and loss is often inevitable. In this section, death compares beauty with brutality and ugliness with gloriousness. These comparisons help to point out the ideas of kindness versus evil. An example of this previously in the book was the Nazi guard whipping Hans Hubermann after he was kind by giving one of the Jews that is being marched a piece of bread. This shows that in the world, there will always be good and bad, and never just one or the other. Death’s statement that he is “haunted by humans” demonstrates the worse side of this idea. While Death performs his job taking lives, he observes the stories of individuals like Liesel. By forming this connection through their stories, he realizes how cruel humans can be. Usually, humans are said to be haunted by death, a cruel power in the universe. However, the personification of Death throughout the novel as well as his thoughts in this passage show that death is merely a natural consequence of our own actions.

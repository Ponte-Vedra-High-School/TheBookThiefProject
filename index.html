 <strong>Book Review:</strong> <br>
 I enjoyed The Book Thief very much, and I would recommend it to a friend. The setting of Germany during World War II was very interesting to me because it is significant in world history, and shows the perspectives of individuals during this time. For instance, it showed how everyday Germans fully supported Hitler. One shop owner in the story required everyone to proclaim their support for Hitler before serving them, and all of the children participated in the Hitler Youth Program. This was interesting to me because I had not considered the perspectives of everyday citizens in Germany during this time. However, I thought the viewpoints of charcaters like Hans Hubermann were also interesting and refreshing. He did not buy into the Nazi ideology even if his son called him a coward for it, showing the importance of individual thought and not giving in to peer pressure. This book was similar to The War That Saved My Life by Kimberly Brubaker. The main similarities were in the main characters. In The War That Saved my life, the main character has a crippled foot and is moved to a foster home to avoid the dangers of war. In The Book Thief, Liesel has no ability to read or write and is also moved to a foster home for the same reason. Both characters initially show weakness, but eventually overcome it. In The War That Saved My Life, the main character learns to ride horses so that she still has mobility, even with her injured foot. Liesel learn to read and write, overcoming a barrier she previously faced. Both stories occur during World War II in Europe, which is a setting that interests me. This book would be a good read for anyone interested in historical fiction, especially during this time period. Additionally, The Book Thief is unique because it is narrated by Death itself. This provides a different perspective on events as it is told by somebody separate from the characters, while also having a voice and thoughts of its own. However, Deathâ€™s perspective is also very emotional. It follows the deaths of many people, and especially moving are the ones who were close to Liesel. The novel showcases many themes such as the love and hate of human nature, the power of literacy, and the duality of peoples. One example of the power of literacy in this book is when Liesel and Max paint over parts of Mein Kampf in order to write stories of their own. This is also demonstrated when Max points out that Hitler mainly used words to gain support, not brute force. These are important lessons about life, and the author, Markus Zusak, does an amzing job of presenting them. Overall, this was an excellent novel and I would recommend it to my peers.<br>

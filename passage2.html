  <p><strong>Passage 2: Character Development</strong>
    <br>“’Come on, Liesel.’ He stuck the book under her nose. ‘Help me out, will you?’
    <br>Liesel helped him out, all right.
    <br>She stood up and took the book from him, and as he smiled over his shoulder at some other kids, she threw it away and kicked him as hard as she could in the vicinity of the groin.” 
    <br>– The Book Thief, page 78
    <br>Prior to this passage, Liesel had been struggling to read part of a book in front of her class, and received a beating for it. Her classmate, Ludwig Schmeikl, was taunting her for not being able to read. Liesel finally retaliates and beats him up without remorse. Previously, Liesel had been described as a small little girl, and not someone who would be expected to fight one of her peers. She would take abuse from her foster mother and simply not respond, in fear of worse punishment. She was frail and skinny, and had just suffered the death of her brother and moving away from her mother. This part of the novel demonstrates a shift in her character as she finally stands up for herself against her classmate, who was porobably stronger than her. Later, she says that she is not stupid. This signifies the importance of knowledge to Liesel, as the cause of this shift in character was based on her reading ability. Her lashing out onher classmate shows that Liesel had a lot of anger inside of her, and it was finally being released.

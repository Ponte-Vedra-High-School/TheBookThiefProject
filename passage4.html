  <p><strong>Passage 4: Symbolism</strong>
    <br>“He made three separate formations that led to the same tower of dominoes in the middle. Together, they would watch everything that was so carefully planned collapse, and they would all smile at the beauty of destruction.” 
    <br>– The Book Thief, page 408
    <br>This passage describes how Rudy was playing with dominoes with his siblings. The dominoes, however, represent more than just a means for the children to entertain themsleves. One posible interpretation of the dominoes is the war. Each domino falling may represent the deaths during the war. Additionally, the dominoes symbolize the inevitability of destruction. Just as one domino falls after the other, more deaths lead to even more in war. The children smiling may represent the Nazi leaders who were in power, that escaped the suffering that most people faced and were the ones who knocked over the first dominoes. The phrase “the beauty of destruction” demonstrates irony in that destruction, which is typically regarded with negative feelings of devastation and loss, is said to be beautiful. Another posible meaning of the dominoes is family. The falling dominoes could represent the losses that Liesel faces throughout the novel, from her brother to her foster parents and new best friend. Her family and friends that had seemed so closely connected to her had fallen away one after the other, just like the dominoes. In this case, Rudy and his siblings pushing over the dominoes may represent the war, or even death itself who is taking away the lives of those close to Liesel.

  <p><strong>Passage 1: Setting</strong>
    <br>
  “The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and stirring. In some places, it was burned. There were black crumbs, and pepper, streaked across the redness.
  <br>Earlier, kids had been playing hopscotch there, on the street that looked like oil-stained pages. When I arrived, I could still hear the echoes. The feet tapping the road. The children-voices laughing, and the smiles like salt, but decaying fast.
  <br>Then, bombs.”
  <br>– The Book Thief, page 12
  <br>This passage is from the beginning of the story when the narrator, Death, is describing the three times that he has seen the book thief. Later in this chapter, the book thief’s home is destroyed with fire and bombs.  The beginning helps to provide a preview of what is to come later in the chapter by illustrating the scene of a city that has been through a bombing, with red skies and smoke. The figurative language helps to intensify the setting through the use of strong imagery. The author’s description of the sky as “boiling and stirring” contributes to a feeling of severity, as if something terrible has happened. In the latter half of this passage, the author describes children playing on the street before the bombing. This segment has an almost nostalgic feeling, creating a positive mood. This happy setting provides an extreme contrast with the despair of the town after the bombing, demonstrating how quickly things can change for the worse, especially in times of war.

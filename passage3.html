  <p><strong>Passage 3: Figurative Language</strong>
    <br> “He was the crazy one who had painted himself black and defeated the world.
    <br>She was the book thief without the words.
    <br>Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like the rain.” 
    <br>– The Book Thief, page 80
    <br>This passage has multiple different uses of figurative language. At first, the autor uses the hyperbole of Rudy “defeating the world” to emphasize the importance of his previous actions, and how unique he was. The author also exaggerates Liesel’s lack of “words.” Although at this point, Liesel had started to learn some reading and writing, the author’s use of hyperbole helps show how far Liesel still has to go in her learning. The personification of the words as if they are on a journey provides a sense of urgency. There is also a sense of security in that the words will definitely come to Liesel. When she finally has “the words,” Liesel will treasure and use this ability. The image of her holding the words in her hands reinforces the idea that Liesel will value them greatly. The autor uses simile to compare the words to clouds and Liesel wringing them out to the rain. This puts emphasis on the power of the ability to read and write by comparing it to a large natural phenomenon. Liesel’s ability to use them is well represented by the rain, as it will have a large effect and she will be unstoppable.
